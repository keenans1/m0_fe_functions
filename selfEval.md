# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

time management is getting better everyday. Personally i like trello more than google calendar. Trello makes it much easier to get specific tasks done one at a time and stay on schedule. try trello :)

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

a function is like a recipe, you can write whatever you want in the recipe. But, the recipe will never
be made until you actually make it (call it)!

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

the parameters are the hard coded variables in the Function
the arguments are the actual data you pass in when the function is called

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?

how can we collaborate more and better together to help and accelarate everyones learning?
